# OpenTelemetry

This SDK produces [metrics](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/metrics/) using [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) that allow you to view data such as request timings. These metrics also include attributes for the model and store ID, as well as the API called to allow you to build reporting.

When an OpenTelemetry SDK instance is configured, the metrics will be exported and sent to the collector configured as part of your applications configuration. If you are not using OpenTelemetry, the metric functionality is a no-op and the events are never sent.

In cases when metrics events are sent, they will not be viewable outside of infrastructure configured in your application, and are never available to the OpenFGA team or contributors.

### Default Metrics

Not all metrics and attributes are enabled by default.

Some attributes, like `fga-client.user` have been disabled by default due to their high cardinality, which may result for very high costs when using some SaaS metric collectors.
If you expect to have a high cardinality for a specific attribute, you can disable it by updating the `TelemetryConfig` accordingly.
